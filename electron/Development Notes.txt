Search electron project files for the variable "whiteListedModules", I found it in .electron-vue/webpack.renderer.config.js

let whiteListedModules = ['vue']

In my scenario, I had added bootstrap-vue package to my project and whenever I was interacting with vue components supplied from bootstrap-vue I was encountering the error, this means that the bootstrap-vue was loading in the second instance of Vue which causes the $attr readonly errors and similar errors.

In order prevent you application having two instances of Vue, you need to add the offending package into the whiteListedModules array, along with vue:

let whiteListedModules = ['vue', 'bootstrap-vue']

Now I do not get the $attr readonly errors or anything else, and vue and bootstrap vue run fine.
